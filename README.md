The A32NX and A380X Projects are community-driven open source projects to recreate a free Airbus A320-200N and A380-800 in Microsoft Flight Simulator that are as close to reality as possible.

The following aircraft configurations are currently simulated or targeted:

### A320-200N (LEAP)

 ```
 Model       A320-251N
 Engine      CFM LEAP 1A-26
 APU         APS3200
 FMS         Honeywell Release H4
 FWC Std.    H2F13
 RA          Honeywell ALA-52B
 TAWS        Honeywell EGPWS
 ACAS        Honeywell TPA-100B
 ATC         Honeywell TRA-100B
 MMR         Honeywell iMMR
 WXR         Honeywell RDR-4000
 ```

### A380-800 (Trent 900)

```
Model       A380-842
Engines     Rolls-Royce Trent 972B-84
APU         APU - Pratt & Whitney PW980
WV          003
TAWS        Honeywell AESS
ACAS        Honeywell AESS
ATC         Honeywell AESS
WXR         Honeywell AESS
```

Please note that this configuration may change in the future as the projects evolve and change.

## How to download and use the aircraft

To download the aircraft please go to the [FlyByWire Simulations website](https://flybywiresim.com). Please be sure to thoroughly read the [documentation](https://docs.flybywiresim.com) on how to install and use the aircraft.

If you're still running into problems after reading through the documentation, feel free to jump into our Discord [#support channel](https://discord.gg/snueqJjDUN).

### Known issues and bug reporting

Our [known issues](https://docs.flybywiresim.com/aircraft/support/known-issues/) list contains the most commonly reported issues. Should you have an issue not found on this list, then please take a look at the reported issues within the [issue tracker](https://github.com/flybywiresim/aircraft/issues/) and report a new issue if your issue isn't found there. You can also use the issue tracker to request a new feature.

## FAQ

### What liveries are available?

Liveries for the A32NX can be found on [Flightsim.to](https://flightsim.to/c/liveries/flybywire-a32nx/).

Liveries for the A380X can be found on [Flightsim.to](https://flightsim.to/liveries/flybywire-a380x/).

### When is the next update?

We don't know, since it depends on many factors. We will announce each new stable version via [Discord](https://discord.gg/flybywire) and our social media channels listed above.

### How do I join the team?

Read [Contributing.md](.github/Contributing.md) and join our Discord to get started.

### Are FlyByWire aircraft payware?

No, they are completely free aircraft, open-source, including SimBridge and other FlyByWire projects which are publicly accessible via GitHub.

### How do we report bugs?

Please read the [known Issues and bug reporting](#known-issues-and-bug-reporting) section.

### Is this going to be "study-level"?

While many in the team dislike the term "study-level" as its use is mostly applicable to certified training devices, we are in fact very dedicated on bringing a high fidelity A320-200N and A380-800 to the Microsoft Flight Simulator platform.

### Is feature X from the real aircraft going to be implemented?

Chances are, yes! While we do not guarantee every single detail of the aircraft will eventually be represented, our goal is to produce an extremely accurate simulation based on technical data and real-world testing. This means you can be almost certain every feature of the aircraft will eventually be simulated to the best of the simulator's ability as long as the technical data backs it up.

### Why has feature X not been implemented yet?

It's very likely that the feature you are awaiting is already under development! However, we strive for the greatest accuracy possible when producing aircraft, and it is therefore likely that a great deal of time will be spent on developing a proper software design and gathering sufficient references before we are able to offer the feature.

### Why is my version not the same as what I see others using?

We have two mainline versions: stable and development. The stable version is a 'snapshot' of the development which we regard as stable with the current version of the simulator. The developer build is updated daily and is a constant work in progress and although we test thoroughly each update, minor issues may occur from time to time.

You can read more about the differences between the versions we offer [on our documentation portal](https://docs.flybywiresim.com/aircraft/install/fbw-versions/).

### Is there a list of features or a changelog available?

We do not keep a list of features implemented, but a lengthy [changelog](https://github.com/flybywiresim/aircraft/blob/master/.github/CHANGELOG.md) of what has been implemented, and their associated [pull requests](https://github.com/flybywiresim/aircraft/pulls) can be [found here](https://github.com/flybywiresim/aircraft/blob/master/.github/CHANGELOG.md).
