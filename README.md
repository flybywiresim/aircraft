## About

The A32NX Project is a community-driven open source project to create a free Airbus A320neo in Microsoft Flight Simulator that is as close to reality as possible.

**Note that this repository exclusively contains the source code for the mainline edition. A32NX: Marketplace Edition sources are located [here](https://github.com/flybywiresim/a32nx-marketplace-edition).**

The following aircraft configuration is currently simulated:

 ```
 Model       A320-251N
 Engine      CFM LEAP 1A-26
 FMGS        Honeywell Pegasus II
 FWC Std.    H2F9C
 ```

Please note that this configuration may change in the future as the A32NX project evolves and changes.

## Downloads
**Warning:** All versions of the A32NX have been forked as a separate package/aircraft in MSFS, and will appear separate from the default A320neo. Existing Asobo A320neo liveries will be incompatible with the new package.

## Installation

### Please follow ALL steps in this README if you encounter any issues with installation before seeking support.

Open the zip that you downloaded from one of the links above, and drag the `flybywire-aircraft-a320-neo` folder inside the zip into your `Community` folder.

See below for the location of your `Community` folder:

For the Microsoft Store edition AND/OR Gamepass edition:
- Copy the `flybywire-aircraft-a320-neo` folder into your community package folder. The path is:
`C:\Users\[YOUR USERNAME]\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.FlightSimulator_<RANDOMLETTERS>\LocalCache\Packages\Community`.

For the Steam edition:
- Copy the `flybywire-aircraft-a320-neo` folder into your community package folder. The path is:
`C:\Users\[YOUR USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft Flight Simulator\Packages\Community`.

For the Boxed edition:
- Copy the `flybywire-aircraft-a320-neo` folder into your community package folder. The path is:
`C:\Users\[YOUR USERNAME]\AppData\Local\MSFSPackages\Community`.

If the above methods do not work:
- You can find your `Community` folder by going into MSFS general options and enabling developer mode. Once enabled, you will notice a bar pop up at the top of your screen. Go to tools and virtual file system. Click on watch bases and your `Community` folder will be listed in one of the folders.
- Please make sure you're copying the `flybywire-aircraft-a320-neo` folder into your `Community` package folder, **NOT** the `flybywiresim-a32nx` folder.

## Known Issues (Please note that most issues are being worked on and some of them may even be fixed in the master branch)

- Captain's PFD may occasionally turn off during flight
- No Smoking switch doesn't use a full range of motion.
- Automatic ECAM page switching has minor bugs.
- AP not following the flight plan (leaking input values affect, but don't disconnect the AP) [Workaround: Set dead-zones for your input device higher]
- Autopilot goes direct to RWY on APP (same with the default A320) [Workaround: Use DIR to a waypoint or selected heading]
- Upper ECAM displays wrong THR levers position / N1 rating.
- Newly added ASOBO A320 liveries are incompatible with the A32NX mod.
- Rudder keybindings not working (you have to set your keybinding to rudder axis right and left)
- Wing dips on landing (due to bad transition to direct law in flare, same with the default A320)  [Workaround use minimal aileron input on landing]
- Black screens/unable to start (conflict with another mod/livery or incorrect installation of the A32NX mod, use the [installer](https://api.flybywiresim.com/installer))
- Invisible plane, no sounds? Reinstall A32NX, delete any old version from your `Community` folder.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I download the aircraft in the current state?**

A: Yes, see [downloads.](#downloads)

**Q: What liveries are available?**

**However, default A320neo liveries are not compatible on the A32NX.**

**Q: When will it be released?**

A: The project is an ongoing rolling release. See [Downloads](#Downloads).

**Q: When is the next update?**

A: We don't know, since it depends on many factors. We will announce each Stable build update via [Discord](https://discord.gg/flybywire) and our [social media.](#Socials)

**Q: How do I join the team?**

A: Head over to [Contributing.md](.github/Contributing.md) and join our Discord to get started.

**Q: Is it payware?**

A: No, it is a completely free aircraft, open-source.

**Q: How do we report bugs?**

A: You can report bugs to us via the [#support channel](https://discord.gg/snueqJjDUN) in the Discord server. Addtionally, you can start/create a GitHub issue (please make sure your issue doesn't already exist).

**Q: Why is my version not the same as what I see others using?**

A: We have two versions, the Stable and Development (Master). The Stable version is a 'snapshot' of the development which we regard as stable with the current version of the simulator. The Developer build is updated daily and is a constant work in progress and although we test thoroughly each update, minor issues may occur from time to time. If you find this to be the case, you can report these issues in the [#support channel](https://discord.gg/snueqJjDUN) Discord or via GitHub issues (check there is not an existing issue of the same nature as yours).
