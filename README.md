## About
The A32NX Project is a community driven open source project to create a free Airbus A320neo in Microsoft Flight Simulator that is as close to reality as possible. It aims to enhance the default A320neo by improving the systems depth and functionality to bring it up to payware-level, all for free.

Central Repository: https://github.com/flybywiresim/a32nx

**IMPORTANT** The GitHub Master is now the dedicated Dev Build for the A32NX project. **No support will be provided for Developer Build issues**. If you are looking to install the stable version, please visit http://www.flybywiresim.com/a32nx.

## Installation
Installation is really simple. You only have to download the "A32NX" folder.

For the Microsoft Store edition AND/OR Gamepass edition:
* Copy the "A32NX" folder into your community package folder. It is located in:
`C:\Users\[YOUR USERNAME]\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.FlightSimulator_<RANDOMLETTERS>\LocalCache\Packages\Community`.

For the Steam edition:
* Copy the "A32NX" folder into your community package folder. It is located in:

* Copy the "A32NX" folder into your community package folder. It is located in:
`C:\Users\[YOUR USERNAME]\AppData\Local\MSFSPackages\Community`.

If the aforementioned methods do not work:
* You can find your community folder by going into FS2020 general options and enabling developer mode. You will see a menu appear on top. Go to tools and virtual file system. Click on watch bases and your community folder will be listed in one of the folders.
* Please make sure you're copying the "A32NX" folder into your community package folder, NOT the "flybywiresim-a32nx" folder.
