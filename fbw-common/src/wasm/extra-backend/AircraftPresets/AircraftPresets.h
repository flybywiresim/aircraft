 * AircraftPresets is responsible for loading aircraft presets. It reads the procedures from an XML file and creates the presets with the

 * The module is initialized with the MsfsHandler instance and the path to the XML file containing the procedure definitions.<p/>
 *
 * The module is updated in the update method.<br/>
 * It uses various control variables to manage the loading process and the progress of the loading.<br/>
 * It checks if a preset load is requested and if so, it initializes the loading process.<br/>
 * It executes the steps in the procedures in the correct order and sends the progress to the Lvars and the flyPad via COMM_BUS.<p/>
 *
 * The control variables are:<br/>
 * - "<prefix>AIRCRAFT_PRESET_LOAD": The LVAR that is used to request a preset load. It is a number between 1 and 5 and is set to 0 to reset
 *   the request.<br/>
 * - "<prefix>AIRCRAFT_PRESET_LOAD_PROGRESS": The LVAR that is used to track the progress of the preset load.<br/>
 * - "<prefix>AIRCRAFT_PRESET_VERBOSE": The LVAR that is used to set the verbose mode of the preset load (outputs to the MSFS console).<br/>
 * - "<prefix>AIRCRAFT_PRESET_LOAD_EXPEDITE": The LVAR that is used to set the expedited mode of the preset load.<br/>
 * - "<prefix>AIRCRAFT_PRESET_LOAD_EXPEDITE_DELAY": The LVAR that is used to set a delay in ms for the expedited mode of the preset
 *   load.<br/>
