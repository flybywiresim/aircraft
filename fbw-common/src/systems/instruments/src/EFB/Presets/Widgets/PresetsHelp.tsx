        <p className="text-2xl">
          Aircraft Presets act as a virtual Co-Pilot supporting you setting up the aircraft correctly while you are
          preparing the flight management system. The Aircraft Presets do not cover the FMS and FCU setup.
        </p>
        <p className="py-4 text-2xl font-bold">
          You still have to setup the FMS using the MCDU and the FCU according to your flight plan.
        </p>
        <p className="text-2xl">
          <ul className="list-disc text-2xl leading-9">
            <li>
              When clicking on a preset button the corresponding preset procedure will be started. This happens in real
              time as if a Co-Pilot would execute the setup.
            </li>
            <li>
              This means that the preset procedure will take some time to complete especially when waiting for certain
              steps to finish, e.g. ADIRS alignment, APU start, engines start, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can stop and interrupt the procedure anytime by clicking on "Cancel". The procedure will stop after
              the current step is finished. The aircraft will be in a state in-between two presets. You can always press
              a preset again and let it run until completion to make sure a procedure is complete.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you have partly setup the aircraft already the presets will check if the correct setting is already
              done and skip this step. Otherwise it will overwrite your setup.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you change any settings during a running procedure you might confuse your Co-Pilot and end up with an
              incomplete preset state. You can repeat loading the preset in this case.
