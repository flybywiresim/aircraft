; A380 MSN 225 - WV03 A380-842
; 07 Mar 2023 - Fuel System Update

; 10 Feb 2024 - Masses (tanks/cargo) shift 5m fwd to match visual model
; Contact point of wing gear slightgly set higher so it gets less plane weight (shift weight on nose)
; Main gears contact points pushed a bit aft as a compromise between correct tilt animation and weight distribution

; 14 Feb 2024 - Moved CG while keeping correct %Mac offset by moving aero center forward
; Changed contact points and empty mass to match real MSN empty weight load sheet

; 15 Feb 2024 - Activate new spring method and update strut springs

; 19 Jul 2024 - Adjust CG, wheels and fuel tanks to correct model origin to Airbus reference datum offset
; The position of the nose in the model coord. system is 35.1927m. The Airbus reference datum distance from the nose is 7.33m.
; So, the conversion from HArm value to model coordinates in m is: model_coord = (35.1927m + 7.33m) - harm_value

; 13 Sept 2024 fixed some invalid entries in the trigger section

; 22 Oct 2024 Fixed numerous issues with the fuel system. Code added to address MSFS fuel system issues and restrict transfers until airplane is in flight.

;7 	Orientation Heading - Heading - Heading, in degrees, of the point orientation (0° means same heading as the aircraft).
;8 	Jetway Left Bend - A percentage value for the jetway left bend. See the Jetway Values section for more information.
;9 	Jetway Left Deployment - A value, in degrees, for the jetway left deployment. See the Jetway Values section for more information.

; The last six values of an interactive_point are used to properly animate the hood of a jetway in order to best match the shape of the aircraft. This also means that those values are only useful for interactive points of type 0 - Main exit - and only for aircrafts suitable for jetway interaction (defined in the Services section of the Aircraft Editor Aircraft Tab or the [SERVICES] section of aircraft.cfg).
; Those six values are matched with the six animations for the jetway hood. The left and right deployment values are angles in degrees to incline the base of the jetway hood (with 0 being the default vertical position). The left and right bend values are percentages of the bending animation (0 to 100, where 0 is the default state). The top horizontal and vertical values are signed percentages of the corresponding animations (-100 to 100, where 0 is the default state).
