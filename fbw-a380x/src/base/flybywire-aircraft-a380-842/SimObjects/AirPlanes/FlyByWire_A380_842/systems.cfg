[LIGHTS]
; Refer to [ELECTRICAL] for details on how to connect a light to a circuit.
;
; Documentation on adjusting lights through XML templates
;
; There are two types of lights in the cockpit: (1) XML emissives, and (2) volumetric lights.
; These lights can both be turned on or off from within the XML templates. As an example, consider
; the following knob template usage:
;
; <UseTemplate Name="ASOBO_LIGHTING_Knob_Panel_Template">
;     <POTENTIOMETER>85</POTENTIOMETER>
;     <SIMVAR_INDEX>1</SIMVAR_INDEX>
;     <NODE_ID>LIGHTING_Knob_Panel</NODE_ID>
;     <ANIM_NAME>LIGHTING_Knob_Panel</ANIM_NAME>
; </UseTemplate>
;
; Note that this particular template is called 'ASOBO_LIGHTING_Knob_Panel_Template'. 'Panel' is very important here.
; This knob affects the 'Type:4' volumetric lights. 'Type:4' lights are the panel lights. In particular, this knob will turn off the
; 'Type:4#Index:1' light, as 'SIMVAR_INDEX' is set to '1'. Note that the POTENTIOMETER is also adjusted as you move the knob.
;
; When the knob is set to the off position, the '(A:LIGHT PANEL ON, Bool)' simvar is set to 0. This in turn will affect anything
; depending on that particular simvar and might lead to unexpected behaviour. In particular, XML emissives are affected by this.
; The 'ASOBO_LIGHTING_Panel_Emissive_Template' is an example of such an XML emissive. If you use this particular
; template, then whenever you turn the knob to the off position, this particular emissive will stop emitting light.
;
; There are other templates for certain other types. For example, 'ASOBO_LIGHTING_Knob_Pedestal_Template' affects 'Type:11' pedestal lights.
;
; In many situations you don't want your emissive to be affected by the TYPE. You just want the emissive to be affected by the
; potentiometer. For these situations you should use the 'ASOBO_LIGHTING_Knob_Potentiometer_Template' to control the potentiometer
; and the 'ASOBO_LIGHTING_Potentiometer_Emissive_Template' to show the emissive.
;
; Make sure to never use a type specific knob more than once. If you need to control multiple lights of the same type,
; then do so using multiple 'ASOBO_LIGHTING_Knob_Potentiometer_Template' templates. At that point you'll no longer have a knob turning
; the simvar managing all lights of that type ON or OFF. Therefore, you have to ensure that in all the relevant '.flt' files you
; turn that type of light ON (e.g. 'GlareshieldLights=True'). Otherwise the lights will not illuminate. Make sure to set the potentiometers
; of those lights to '0' in the '.flt' file if you don't want them to be illuminated when starting a flight.
;
; LIGHT SPECIFIC IMPL. NOTES
; - Changes to LocalPosition does not have any effect if the light is attached to a node.
; - Angles for spotlights are divided by half. 180° == 90°.
; - Adding a *.fx file requires a complete sim restart as these files are loaded once during startup.
; - Adding/renaming a *.fx file requires a re-compile of aircraft to generate a new layout.json.
; - Changes to this systems.cfg file can be reloaded in sim using the File -> Resync option in the Aircraft Editor window.
; - Color Start/End in *.fx file, controls what color the light has during day or night.
; - Color Start/End in *.fx file, also controls the color of any sprite/texture used, if not using #EmMesh.
; - You can't combine volumetric and non volumetric in the same *.fx file, it is all volumetric or none nothing.
; - Enumeration of lightdef.N or order does not matter. A lightdef.999 will show up as lightdef.75 in sim, if 74 was the last one in the list.
; - Range for a spotlight can't be smaller than 0.1, even if it works in the User Lights window.
; - A resync wont initialize the special "always-on-lights" attached to Type:13#Index:0, a flight restart is needed.
;
; TESTING OF CIRCUITS AND BUSES
; - To unpower AC BUS 1, push GEN 1 and BUS TIE to OFF.
; - To unpower AC BUS 2, push GEN 2 and BUS TIE to OFF.
; - To unpower AC ESS, push ESS FEED button to ALTN, BUS TIE to OFF and GEN 2 to OFF. This will also unpower AC BUS 2.
; - To unpower DC 1, DC 2, DC BAT, go to failures in the EFB and fail all TRs.
