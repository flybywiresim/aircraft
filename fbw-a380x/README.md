# A380X Project Files

The project directory is structured as follows:

```text
- docs            <Specific docs for the project>
- src             <src files required for the project>
- out             <contains MSFS package folder after the build>
```

The `out` folder can be deleted as it is completely recreated during the build.
This is essentially a clean build.

## A380X INOP systems

These systems are currently not operational / these features are missing and shall thus not lead to bug reports.

This list is divided into standardized ATA chapters, if there are no noteworthy systems missing from a chapter, the chapter heading is hidden (this was different in a previous version of this list). This list is not exhaustive, there might be details missing in other systems which are not stated here.

<!-- ### ATA 20 Aircraft General / Exterior 3D Model -->

<!-- ### ATA 21 Air Con / Pressurization / Ventilation -->

<!-- ### ATA 22 Flight Envelope -->

### ATA 22 Autoflight / FCU

- FLS
- THR NOISE, DCLB
- AFS CP ALT button (immediate level-off, and alt hold indication)

### ATA 22 Flight Management System (FMS)

- Incomplete pages see [fbw-a380x/src/systems/instruments/src/MFD/pages](https://github.com/flybywiresim/aircraft/tree/master/fbw-a380x/src/systems/instruments/src/MFD/pages)
- Full separation into three synchronized FMCs and two FMSs (currently one FMC serving one FMS)
- EO modes / EO SID
- Accurate CI, OPT and REC MAX FL computation
- NADP (see THR NOISE above)
- Fuel planning on FMS/FUEL&LOAD page
- ATC / datalink / CPDLC
- FCU BKUP
- STEP ALTs: Optimum step calculation

### ATA 23 Communication

- RMP: HF, TEL, MENU, SATCOM, DATALINK pages
- CIDS: CALLS buttons

<!-- ### ATA 24 Electrical -->

<!-- ### ATA 25 Equipment / Cockpit 3D Model -->

<!-- ### ATA 26 Fire and Smoke Protection -->

### ATA 27 Flight Controls

- Completely migrated SLAT/FLAP CTL implementation (adapted A32NX computers at the moment)
- Automatic THS setting on ground

### ATA 28 Fuel

- Refuel Driver/Refuel Application placeholder pseudo-FQMS implementation (pre-cursor for realistic FQMS implementation while supporting instant load)
  - CPIOM etc. not implemented yet.
- Portions of the automatic fuel transfer system -- main transfers from the inner, mid, trim, and outer tanks are implemented with the correct scheduling as are CG control transfers from the trim tank to the appropriate inner, mid, or feed tanks. Not implemented yet are load alleviation transfers, transfers based on remaining time to destination, cold fuel transfers, and automatic transfers
  that occur on the ground. The transfer pump pushbuttons work and can be used to interrupt an automatic transfer.
- The crossfeed valves work, but fuel will not be taken from the correct tank until the FADEC WASM is modified
- Manual fuel transfer
- Manually controlling how much fuel each tank receives when fueling
- Integrated Refuel Panel - Simulated in the systems but not modeled in the plane model, or fully connected to ELEC
- MFD entry - Not supported yet (ZFW/ZFWCG entry - Possible via EFB currently for testing)

### ATA 29 Hydraulic System

- No accumulators / LEHGS systems
- Brakes: Systems were carried over from A32NX, with adapted parameters for A380X
- Gear system: Some systems were carried over from A32NX, with adapted parameters for A380X
- Hydraulic actuation of flaps/slats not finalized
- Hydraulics Cooling

<!-- ### ATA 30 Ice and Rain Protection -->

### ATA 31 Indicating / Recording / ECAM / EFIS / Displays

- CDS / displays (automatic) reconfiguration
- PFD backup scales
- Interactive ND
- Vertical Display: Only fixed vertical range (until FL240) w/o FMS trajectory
- Independent QNH
- KCCU soft keyboard
- ECAM: Completely accurate STS page implementation
- ECAM: AUTO RCL
- ECAM: Correct behavior of RCL / RCL LAST
- ECAM: Time limited failures
- Video: ETACS due to sim limitation
- Latest FMA indications for landing modes (e.g. LAND3 instead of CAT3)
- SD VIDEO page

### ATA 32 Landing Gear / Braking / BTV

- Gear system not yet final
  - Wrong door sequence
- BTV simplified logic only
  - Basic braking distance calculations
  - No glide slope adaptation
  - No handling of brakes/OANS errors

- Push button in overhead for logo lights

### ATA 34 Navigation

- MMR implementation including GPIRS position
- GLS

### ATA 34 Surveillance / TCAS / TAWS / WXR / XPDR

- Weather radar / WXR
- TAWS obstacles

### ATA 34 ROW/ROP

- Automatic detection of landing runway (needs FMS to have landing runway selected)
- Shift of touchdown point according to position on glide slope

### ATA 35 Oxygen

- Oxygen masks test P/B

<!-- ### ATA 36 Bleed Air -->

### ATA 42 Avionics Network

- Communication between systems using AFDX (ARINC protocol used mostly)

<!-- ### ATA 49 APU -->

### ATA 52 Doors

- CKPT DOOR functions
- All cargo and passenger doors animated. Most of main deck done right now

### ATA 70 Engines

- Custom engine model (current model is modified LEAP-1A)
